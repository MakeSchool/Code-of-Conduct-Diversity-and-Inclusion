# Diversity and Inclusion Statement

Diversity is a key element to the success of organizations and the tech community. Freedom of thought and the open exchange of ideas are key to an effective learning environment and central to [Make School](https://www.makeschool.com). That kind of exchange can happen only in an environment that recognizes the value of each person and fosters mutual respect. Make School is committed to increasing and fostering a diverse community of staff and students.

# Code of Conduct

This code of conduct applies to community members and Make School team members in all Make School communities online (including but not limited to Make School student dorms, Make School Slack groups, Twitter, and Facebook), in the Make School office, and at all events hosted by or at Make School.

Our community is dedicated to creating an inclusive environment for everyone, regardless of race, ethnicity, nationality, religion, color, sex, sexual orientation, gender identity, national origin, age, disability (physical or mental), genetic information, parental status, marital status, political affiliation, veterans status, mental illness, socioeconomic status or background, neuro(a)typicality, physical appearance, body size, computing experience, or clothing. Consider that calling attention to differences can feel alienating.

We do not tolerate harassment of community members in any form. Harassment includes offensive verbal comments related to the protected classes above, sexual images in public spaces, deliberate intimidation, stalking, following, photography or audio/video recording against reasonable consent, sustained disruption of talks or other events, inappropriate physical contact, and unwelcome sexual attention (even without sexual contact). Harassment does not need to be recognized as unwanted or unwelcome by anyone other than the person being harassed. Be careful in the words that you choose. Remember that sexist, racist, and other exclusionary jokes can be offensive to those around you. Offensive jokes are not appropriate and will not be tolerated under any circumstances. 

Participants asked to stop any harassing behavior are expected to comply immediately. Community members violating these rules may be sanctioned or removed from community spaces.

If you are being harassed, notice that someone else is being harassed, or have any other concerns, please contact one of the founders immediately: 

- Ashu Desai ([ashu@makeschool.com](mailto:ashu@makeschool.com))
- Jeremy Rossmann ([jeremy@makeschool.com](mailto:jeremy@makeschool.com))
