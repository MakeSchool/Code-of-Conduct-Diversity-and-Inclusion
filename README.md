# Diversity and Inclusion Statement

Diversity is a key element to the success of organizations and the tech community. Freedom of thought and the open exchange of ideas are key to an effective learning environment and central to [Make School](https://www.makeschool.com). That kind of exchange can happen only in an environment that recognizes the value of each person and fosters mutual respect. Make School is committed to increasing and fostering a diverse community of staff and students.

# Code of Conduct

Since anywhere you go you are an ambassador for Make School, this code applies to community members and Make School team members in all Make School spaces, such as the Make School office and at all events hosted by or at Make School HQ. This code also extends beyond the walls of Make School HQ and into any space, such as residence halls, field trips/site visits, co-working spaces. This code also extends to digital spaces including social media (Facebook, Twitter, SnapChat, Slack, LinkedIn, Reddit, etc) and your online public persona in general.

Our community is dedicated to creating an inclusive environment for everyone, regardless of race, ethnicity, nationality, religion, skin color, sex, sexual orientation, gender identity, national origin, age, health (physical or mental), genetic information, parental status, marital status, political affiliation, veteran status, socioeconomic status or background, neuro(a)typicality, appearance, body size, computing experience, or clothing. Consider that calling attention to differences can feel alienating.

Our community does not tolerate harassment in any form towards any person. Harassment includes offensive verbal comments related to the protected classes above, sexual images in public spaces, deliberate intimidation, stalking, following, photography or audio/video recording against reasonable consent, sustained disruption of talks or other events, inappropriate physical contact, and unwelcome sexual attention (even without sexual contact). Harassment does not need to be recognized as unwanted or unwelcome by anyone other than the person being harassed. Be careful in the words that you choose. Remember that sexist, racist, and other exclusionary jokes can be offensive to those around you. Offensive jokes are not appropriate and will not be tolerated under any circumstances.

Participants asked to stop any harassing behavior are expected to comply immediately. Community members violating this code will be addressed fairly and expediently. Violators may be sanctioned or removed from community spaces.

If you are being harassed, notice that someone else is being harassed, or have any other concerns, please immediately contact the Student Experience Lead, one of the founders, or Susan Nesbitt (alternatively):

- Jade Stone ([jade@makeschool.com](mailto:jade@makeschool.com))
- Ashu Desai ([ashu@makeschool.com](mailto:ashu@makeschool.com))
- Jeremy Rossmann ([jeremy@makeschool.com](mailto:jeremy@makeschool.com))
- alternatively: Susan Nesbitt ([susan@makeschool.com](mailto:susan@makeschool.com))

# Harassment Policy

Harassment of any kind is not acceptable behavior at Make School; it is inconsistent with the commitment to excellence that characterizes Make School’s activities. Make School is committed to creating an environment in which every individual can work, study, and live without being harassed. Harassment may therefore lead to sanctions up to and including termination of employment or student status.

Harassment is any conduct, verbal or physical, on or off campus, that has the intent or effect of unreasonably interfering with an individual’s or group’s educational or work performance at Make School or that creates an intimidating, hostile, or offensive education, work, or living environment. Some kinds of harassment are prohibited by civil laws or by Make School policies on conflict of interest and nondiscrimination.

Harassment on the basis of race, ethnicity, nationality, religion, skin color, sex, sexual orientation, gender identity, national origin, age, health (physical or mental), genetic information, parental status, marital status, political affiliation, veteran status, socioeconomic status or background, neuro(a)typicality, appearance, body size, computing experience, or clothing. It includes harassment of an individual in terms of a stereotyped group characteristic, or because of that person’s identification with a particular group.

Sexual harassment may take many forms. Sexual assault and requests for sexual favors that affect educational or employment decisions constitute sexual harassment. However, sexual harassment may also consist of unwanted physical contact, requests for sexual favors, visual displays of degrading sexual images, sexually suggestive conduct, or offensive remarks of a sexual nature.

Make School is committed under this policy to stopping harassment and associated retaliatory behavior. All Make School supervisors have a responsibility to act to stop harassment in the areas under their supervision.

Any member of the Make School community who feels harassed is encouraged to seek assistance and resolution of the complaint. Make School provides a variety of avenues by which an individual who feels harassed may proceed, so that each person may choose an avenue appropriate to his or her particular situation. Make School procedures are intended to protect the rights of both the complainant and the respondent, to protect privacy, and to prevent supervisory reprisal.
